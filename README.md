# Foundation Semester Software Engineering 

Software Engineering Foundation Semester Resources and Exercises

Contains my first exercises, experiences and projects related to Software Engineering, done and learned in the foundation semester @CODE University Berlin!

The folders are sorted by 1,2,3... for a reason. The reason simply is which part/week of the semester we worked on that topic/exercise.
